        "heading":"Hi, I'm Dennis",
        "body":["I've been on a fun journey of following my academic and professional curiosity, which amounted to an interesting mix of skills and experiences. I will tell you about some of my favorites. First year in my bachelors, I started with a deep interest in art and culture, however after one year of architecture I realized that I had a lot of questions about the natural world that architecture may not be able to answer. I transferred to engineering school and graduated with a mechanical engineering degree. All the physics and math classes gave me a base of understanding for how the world works, and only fueled my continued interest for the natural world. I find engineering inspirational because it's the basic nuts and bolts, it is the industry that combines fun science and human ingenuity and solves real world complex problems. Engineering is tangible, impactful, creative yet governed by the same laws of physics that Aristotle, Galileo, and Einstein observed over the centuries.",
            "Within the last 5 years, my mechanical engineering work slowly transitioned into more software and eventually data science. I learned that with software, unlike engineering, the develop-test cycle is instantaneous. One can learn a new skill, turn around, and apply it immediately.",
            "The state of information technology as I saw it a few years ago, and as I still see it today, is mostly of awe. Imagine you land on a deserted alien planet with advanced infrastructure and technology that clearly served a critical role in their society. The alien civilization was quite wise and left many clues as to how to interact with the leftover technologies, how to maintain and build new technologies. Now, any person that is interested in IT and computer science can scour the alien artifacts and figure out how to take advantage of a truly astonishing technology that we inherited.",
            "A transition from mechanical engineering to computer science didn't quiet seem natural yet. Dealing with data and optimization in every aspect of engineering, Data Science was quiet enticing and fascinating from the first moments I became aware of the field. AI and machine learning techniques are world wonders that propelled us into an era of computer vision, computer learning, and AI. I started to transition into software development and data science projects. I finished my master’s in data science and Analytics in Fall of 2021 and I was lucky enough to graduate and have real life work experience at the same time. For the last several years, I spent most of my professional time developing AWS infrastructure, which yet again, took me on a fun track of discovering a completely new field. Cloud application and distributed processing work is incredibly rewarding and clearly an important part of the near future."],

The difficulty in gaining a robust intuition for tensordot is mostly due to the fact that if you need a tensordot operation, your mind is likely already dazed with keeping track of all the dimensions of a tensor. To get a full grasp of tensordots, it helps to start from simple matrices then slowly build an intuition all the way up to multidimensional operations.",
